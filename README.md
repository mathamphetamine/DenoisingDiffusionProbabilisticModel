## Implementation of the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model

This repository contains my implementation of the "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model" paper, which can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239).

For a more detailed explanation of the paper, you can refer to various YouTube videos such as [this one](https://youtu.be/HoKDTa5jHvg?si=40v7a2RLS3jXjTzI).
